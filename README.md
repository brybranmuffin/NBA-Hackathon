# NBA-Hackathon

We still need to merge the lineup and game tables so that player 1, player 2, and player 3 will have their teams clearly written out

About the game table: event 12 indicates start of a period game, we will get starting lineups for that period from the lineups table. we can talk about our approach to this problem later, but I outlined one way to do it in the NBA file. 

Haven't started the other problem yet
